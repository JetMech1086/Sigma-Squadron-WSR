      In closing, there are a few of you we have been trying to reach. We understand that real 
      life gets busy, especially right now with school starting back up and everyone being tied up in work. All we 
      ask is that you communicate with us.  Remember to reach out to myself or your flight leader if you have any questions or concerns.
